----------------------  SAT-Race_TS_1  ---------------------

This is the first Test Set for SAT-Race 2006. It contains
50 instances comparable in size and hardness to what we
will use for SAT-Race 2006. All instances are packed with
gzip.

Each instance can be solved by at least one of last SAT
competition's ten best solvers in less than 20 minutes,
see 'Solver2005-results.txt' for selected run-times.
(We may use instances without this property in SAT-Race,
too.)
